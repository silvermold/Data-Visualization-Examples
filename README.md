These are various graphs, diagrams, and viewable resources that I created for clientele who were in need of a visual aid to help comprehend the numbers.
A mosaic of technologies were used to create these works to represent my versatility in the everchanging landscape of data.

Information comes in many different forms and each technology that was used to create these visual packages of knowledge has strengths and weaknesses.
As a data analyst it's my job to learn these different technologies so that I can provide the most efficient medium of insight that allows stakeholders to make the best decisions.
